# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description

This project I had to do for my MITxPRO course. I used an API from  Mapbox and an API provided by Massachusetts BayTransportation Authority that showed various buses and tracks them as they move around Boston. (See maps2.js and index2.html)

The other 2 files(maps.js and index.html) show a Map of Bern switzerland from an API provided by Mapbox and tram stations from another API provided by the Swiss government.
