# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description

This project I had to do for my MITxPRO course. I had to use API from a Mapbox and use a url with various buses and track them as they move along Boston. (See maps2.js and index2.html)
The other 2 files(maps.js and index.html) show a Map of Bern switzerland that I downloaded from a public API but did not have the information of the trams to track them.
