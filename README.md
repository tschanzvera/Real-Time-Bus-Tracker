# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description

This project I had to do for my MITxPRO course. I used an API from  Mapbox and an API provided by Massachusetts BayTransportation Authority that showed various buses and tracks them as they move around Boston. (See maps2.js and index2.html) I also did this project using API from Google Maps. (See maps3.js and index3.html)

The other 2 files(maps.js and index.html) show a Map of Bern switzerland from an API provided by Mapbox and tram stations from another API provided by the Swiss government.
