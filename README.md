# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description

This project I had to do for my MITxPRO course. I used an API from  Mapbox and an API provided by Massachusetts BayTransportation Authority that showed various buses and tracks them as they move around Boston. (See maps2.js and index2.html) I also did this project using API from Google Maps. 


The other 2 files(maps.js and index.html) show a Map of Bern switzerland from an API provided by Mapbox and tram stations from another API provided by the Swiss government.


## How to run

Load the url on your browser and click the run button. It should update every 5 seconds. To view this project using Google Maps you will have to obtain your own API key from Google Maps and insert it in the index3.html file. To view this project using Mapbox you will have to get your own access token from Mapbox and insert it in the maps2.js file
To see the map of Bern with the tram stops you will have to get your own access token from Mapbox and insert it in the map.js file.

## Roadmap of future improvements 

I would like to be able to track just one of the buses that I choose
